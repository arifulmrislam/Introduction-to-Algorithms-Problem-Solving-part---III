Pseudoscope of BFS
======================

Input -> Connect Graph and a "source"
Output -> Traverse all nodes and print the traversal order


BFS(graph, source):
- Initiative an array called "visited" and an empty queue "q"
- Mark visited[source] = 1 and q.push(source)
- while node is not empty:
    - head = q.front()
    - q.pop()
    - print the node "head"
    - for all adjacent nodes of 'head':
        - if visited[adjacent_node] == 0:
            - visited[adjacent_node] = 1 and q.push(adjacent_node)
